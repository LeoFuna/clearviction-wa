### New 3rd party dependency justification
If you are looking to implement a new library as part of your pull request, you **must** fill out the information required in the form. Type your answers between the two `|  |` at the end of each line. _Please delete if not relevant._

| Topic      | Questions/considerations | Answer |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Problem statement** | What problem does using this package solve for us? Please provide a concise description of the problem that the proposed package aims to address. This should offer a high-level understanding of why integrating this package is necessary for our project. |   |
| **Cost/subscription** | At this time, we will not accept any libraries that are paid. However, if we are able to use a free tier, it MUST allow unlimited seats and be available for use outside of personal or private repositories. _Please tell us which category this falls under._ |   |
| **Community** | Is there a robust community using this package? _(Weekly downloads, stars and forks on GitHub)_ |   |
| **Maintenance** | How often is the package updated? _(Release frequency, number of issues open on GitHub, is the package new?)_ At a minimum, the latest release should be within the past year. |   |
| **Data privacy** | If our data will be processed through this tool, please verify that data is not being collected or sold for nefarious purposes. _(Please tell us how you verified)_ |   |
| **Security** | Verify that the package does not install malicious code. _(Please tell us how you verified)_ |   |
| **Maintainability** | Does using this require a specialized skill set or have a steep learning curve? Would someone need to take a course in order to learn how to use this library? How extensive is the documentation for this tool? _(Ex: [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) and [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) are difficult to learn, but [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) or [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) are easier to learn)_ |   |
| **Other options** | What other options have you considered, and why did you choose this package? |   |
| **Can we do it ourselves** | Why is an external solution better than a custom solution of our own? |   |
| **Other notes** | Is there any other information you would like to share? |   |
